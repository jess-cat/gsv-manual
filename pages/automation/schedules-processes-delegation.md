# Schedules, Queues, And Delegation

[Schedule And Delegate Work](index.md)

## Ask GSV To Act Later

From an active GSV work shell, schedule a message back to that work item:

```bash
sched add --here --name follow-up --after 2h --message "Check whether the export completed."
```

Other time forms include:

```bash
sched add --here --name daily-review --every 1d --message "Review today's open commitments."
sched add --here --name weekday-review --cron "0 9 * * 1-5" --timezone Europe/Amsterdam --message "Prepare the weekday review."
sched add --here --name appointment --at 2026-09-01T14:00:00Z --message "Remind the user about the appointment."
```

A successful firing means the event reached the work item. Later model work and external delivery report their own outcomes.

## Send Fixed Text Later

Choose an authorized destination from GSV's destination list:

```bash
message destinations --all --json
sched add --to DESTINATION --name reminder --after 30m --message "The oven timer is done."
```

This sends the fixed text without asking a model to compose it at firing time.

## Inspect And Control Schedules

```bash
sched list --all
sched disable <id>
sched enable <id>
sched run <id> --force
sched remove <id>
```

A schedule remains attached to its original work item. After that work item is killed, recreate the schedule for its replacement or remove it.

## Recurring Shell Commands

Use `crontab` for a recurring shell command. Cron runs unattended, so every operation must already be authorized.

## Delegation

Delegation is immediate, bounded work:

```bash
proc delegate --label invoices --check-after 10m "Compare the invoices and return discrepancies."
```

The result returns to the calling work item, and the caller is told at each checkpoint while the child is still running. The caller decides what to send to the person. See [Messages, work, and delegation](../agents-assistants/conversations-delegation.md).

## Queued Work

One work item has one provider request in flight at a time. Schedule events that need their own run queue in order. Delegated results enter the calling work item's active context as soon as the current provider request can observe them. New direct human input may supersede current direct work.

Scheduled work runs without an interactive approver. An operation whose policy requires interactive confirmation fails visibly.
