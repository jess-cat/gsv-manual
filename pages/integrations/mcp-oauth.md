# MCP And OAuth

[Messaging, Email, And Connected Services](index.md)

## Find A Connected Tool

MCP servers expose tools and resources from external services. GSV keeps large tool catalogs out of every prompt and discovers the needed operation on demand:

```bash
mcp status
mcp list
mcp search "create an issue"
mcp tools <server>
mcp describe <server> <tool>
```

Call the selected tool with the arguments shown by `describe`:

```bash
mcp call <server> <tool> --args-json '<arguments>' --json
```

For a workflow involving several calls, use CodeMode or the server's generated CodeMode bindings so intermediate values remain structured.

## Add, Refresh, Or Remove MCP

In the Web app, open **Settings → mcp** and choose **add MCP server**: a name, the server URL, a transport (automatic, streamable HTTP, or server-sent events), and any custom headers such as an API key. A server that uses OAuth shows **sign in** on its row afterwards. Each row offers **refresh** and **remove**; servers added by another account are read only.

From Shell:

```bash
mcp add <name> <url>
mcp refresh <server>
mcp remove <server>
```

Run `mcp help` before changing a connection. Adding needs the `sys.mcp.add` capability, and calling a tool asks for approval under the default policy. Availability depends on the current identity, configuration, server health, capability, and approval policy.

## OAuth Accounts

OAuth authorizes an external account without exposing its bearer token in a message or file:

```bash
oauth list
oauth show <provider-or-account>
oauth device start <provider>
oauth forget <provider-or-account>
```

Use `oauth help` for the exact flow supported by the provider. Confirm the account identity and requested scopes before authorizing it.

OAuth and MCP solve different parts of a connection: OAuth grants account access; MCP exposes operations that may use it.

## Troubleshoot A Missing Tool

Check in this order:

1. the OAuth account exists and has not expired;
2. the MCP server is connected and healthy;
3. the tool catalog has been refreshed;
4. the current identity has the required capability;
5. approval policy permits the operation;
6. the external service accepted the request.

Tool output is external data. The authenticated request and current task determine which instructions GSV follows.
