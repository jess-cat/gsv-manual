# Connect And Route Messaging

[Messaging, Email, And Connected Services](index.md)

## Connect Versus Link

- **Connect** gives GSV access to the messaging service or bot account.
- **Link** proves that a particular external sender is the signed-in GSV owner.

Keeping these separate prevents an untrusted incoming username or chat ID from choosing a local account.

## Telegram

The exact setup depends on the installation:

- With managed Telegram, message the platform bot. It returns a short-lived one-time code. Enter that code while signed in to GSV, inspect the Telegram identity shown, and confirm the link.
- With a standalone bot, connect the BotFather token through the Telegram settings first, message that bot, then redeem its link challenge while signed in.

The message used to create the link may be consumed by setup. Send another message after confirmation to begin the conversation.

## Slack

Connect a Slack app to the workspace through **Settings → messengers**; the operator's shared app, when the installation offers one, needs no app of your own. Then link your Slack identity with the one-time challenge while signed in to GSV. Direct messages to the app reach Ship; channels and threads keep explicit routes. Files shared in Slack become GSV files tied to exact revisions, and GSV can share files back into the conversation.

## WhatsApp

WhatsApp is not currently available. The earlier unofficial adapter was removed; a WhatsApp Business connection is separate future work. If a person asks for it, say so rather than attempting a pairing.

## Discord

Connect a bot with the permissions required by the intended direct messages, servers, channels, and message content. Then link or route the desired surface through GSV. Owner identity is established by the authenticated link challenge.

## Ship And Direct Work Sessions

An ordinary linked private message goes to Ship. In a messenger chat:

- `/where` reports the current selection.
- `/ship` returns future messages to Ship immediately.

GSV can offer a direct line to an owned work item from the active private conversation. The messenger labels that selection as a Work Session. It affects future input on that chat; it does not replace Ship elsewhere or redirect a reply that was already being generated.

From GSV, inspect or change an authorized route with:

```bash
message route show --to here --json
message route set --process PID_OR_LABEL --to here --json
message route clear --to here --json
```

Groups, channels, and threads keep explicit routes. Choose their GSV destination or label from the destination list.

## Attachments And Voice

Incoming images, voice messages, video, and documents become files tied to exact revisions. Transcription may accompany audio, but the original audio remains available.

Outgoing attachments are resolved only when they are sent. The Send tool attaches files staged for the reply; from Shell:

```bash
message send --to DESTINATION --message "Here it is" --attach /path/to/file --also
```

This works on every messaging path when the selected adapter supports that media type. Attaching a document from a connected computer needs that computer's daemon to be current; older daemons can attach only images.

## Delivery And Retries

GSV gives each logical inbound and outbound delivery a stable identity. Each destination receives exactly one correlated send request; GSV owns the durable retry, and the adapter owns provider presentation and idempotency. When provider acceptance is uncertain, the delivery remains ambiguous under the same identity for status checks or a safe retry. Inspect one with `message delivery show <delivery-id>`.

For a direct reply, the endpoint that started the interaction wins. Background Ship events may use the most recently authorized linked private destination.

## Approvals In Messaging

An approval applies only to its exact request token and authorized sender. Bare approval text, stale tokens, and answers from another surface leave the operation unauthorized.
